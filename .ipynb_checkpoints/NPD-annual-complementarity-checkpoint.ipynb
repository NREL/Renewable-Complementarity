    "The purpose of this notebook is to compute the stabilioty and pearson coefficients for 1-year of data using hourly values. The notebook uses the code in the python script `stability_testing.py`to compute the coefficients in a annual basis. That is, an hourly time-series for resource pairs is passed to the corresponding methods to compute an unique value that represents the annual coefficient (stability or pearsons) for a given location. Note that the complementarity metrics are computed separately for PV-Hydro and Wind-Hydro. The process is the same for both pairs. The steps below explain this process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe (DF) `pv_wind_id_df` contains meta data about each stream gage (hydro) and the co-located pv and wind location, along with the path for the synthetic profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `for` loop runs through every row (i.e. every stream gage) of the `pv_wind_id_df` DF, to obtain the filenames for the given gage, and pv and wind locations.\n",
    "2. General housekeeping occurs at the beginning of the loop. For example, we check whether the file exists or if there is data present.\n",
    "3. Read the csv files for hydro and PV/Wind.\n",
    "4. Several steps to clean up and prepare the data for cmputing the stability coefficient take place. At this point, we need to make sure the time-series are synchronous in their time steps. Due to data quality issues, we didn't use the same years in the hydro data, so we need to change the timestamps to match the 2012 year, which is the one used for wind and PV.\n",
    "5. Compute the complementarity metrics."
